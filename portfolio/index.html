	<p>  Hello there. You have arrived at the portfolio site of me. I am a NYC native born and raised in the Bronx now living in Brooklyn. Very passionate about technology, mostly everything gaming console and PC related. If you give me time and practice i can beat you at your best game. I also love graphic design(mostly logo design and commercial poster design) and have a growing passion for front-end web development. My goal is to work in the tech industry as either as a Front-End Developer, Web Designer or User Interface(UI) developer to bring not only my ideas but the ideas of my peers and clients to the world and work my way up to Front-End Engineer.  </p>

	<p>I am currently training as an apprentice web developer under Software Guild working towards my certification learning and mastering the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am also adept in graphic design working advanced with applications such as Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator and After Effects/Sony Vegas for video editing work. For the majority of 2018, I worked as a Concessions Supervisor for Aramark Citifield for the NY Mets which consisted of managing inventory, customer service, cash handling, keeping employees on task and making sure proper service skills were exercised.</p>

	<p>If you didn't catch on earlier I LOVE video games. E3 is like Christmas in June for me. I usually dabble in first-person shooters, fighting games and MMORPG's because I'm a glutton for competition. I also have a deep appreciation for single player games because the world needs good stories not Battle Royale clones. My all time favorite franchises are: Kingdom Hearts, Halo, Sonic Adventure, Megaman X4, Metroid Fusion, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Dead Space, Marvel Vs Capcom, Soul Calibur, Final Fantasy, Star Wars Battlefront II(THE ORIGINAL NOT THE EA VERSION), Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic & KOTOR II: The Sith Lords(The remasters we deserve but will never possibly get.), Prince of Persia: Warrior Within and Destiny(I believe we can be great again).</p>

	<p>I'm also a competitive gamer. I love traveling out to either local or out of state tournaments to play competitively and spectate high level players. Gaming is becoming the ultimate spectator sport. I also like to travel to comic-cons. Food. Can't forget, I also love food. Good food. </p>
